## Machine Learning Motivation

- Calculus and Derivatives are important in machine learning because derivatives are used to optimize functions in particular to maximize them and minimize them.

## Motivation to Derivatives

- The concept of derivative is similar to velocity, a car that goes 100km/hr means that it’s average velocity is 100 km/hr. However you started fast, then went slow, This velocity is not constant.
- At a given instant, what is the velocity at that instant? That's called the **instantaneous velocity**. That is precisely what a **derivative** is.
- A **derivative** is the instantaneous rate of change of a function, In this case, the function is distance and its derivative is velocity
- You can find the average velocity in the interval from 10-15, but you don't know what happened within that interval at time 12.5 exactly.
- The average velocity between the time interval 10-15 seconds is also the **slope** of the **line** that joins the two points in the graph.
- **Velocity** is calculated with the formula, distance over time. This is **synonymous** to the formula for calculating **slope**, which is **rise** over **run**.

- we can have a good estimate for the velocity if we had more data about the distances of time close to t equals 12.5 seconds.

- Notice that we still don't have the estimate of the velocity at 12.5. To find this estimate, We need to take finer and finer intervals and the finer the intervals, the better the estimate is. That leads to the **derivative.**

## Derivatives and Tangents

- Calculating the instantaneous velocity here may be hard, but estimating it is possible.
- let's take another point to the right of **t** equals 12.5 and calculate the average velocity over that interval. That is the slope of this line over here,

- However that was not the instantaneous velocity at t equals 12.5, We can get closer to it by making this interval smaller.

- Imagine putting it so close that you can't even tell the distance between the two.
- You get the limit which is  $\frac {dx}{dt}$  and that is precisely the **tangent line** to the curve at **t** equals 12.5.
- This measure of how fast the distance is changing with respect to time is called the instantaneous rate of change and it is the **slope** of that **tangent line**.
- The **derivative** of a function at a point is precisely the **slope** of the **tangent** at that particular point.

## Slopes, Maxima and Minima

- At any of the points where the tangent is horizontal, therefore, the tangent has Slope 0.

- Notice that the point where the distance was the farthest is coincidentally one of the points where the car was stopped.
- This is no coincidence because if the car is moving, then it could just go further.
- The point where the car is the farthest is a point where the car is not moving.
- That means if you want to find the **maximum** or the **minimum** in a function, it occurs at one of the points where the derivative is **zero**. Or in other words, where the tangent line is **horizontal**.
