## Linear Algebra and Machine Learning

- A common machine learning approach to modeling systems is called Linear Regression

- You can make accurate predictions of the output under the assumption that this is a linear relationship

- You’d find the values of the weight and bias terms that solve all these equations at the same time, From this common machine learning model appears a fundamental  concept of linear algebra called a **system of linear equations**.

- Linear Algebra is all about manipulating vectors and matrices to do powerful calculations, This math is the backbone of many machine learning models.

## System of Sentences

- The way sentences combined to give you information is similar to the way equations combined to give you information.

- When a system is complete is called a **non-singular system**, A **non-singular system** is a system that carries as many pieces of information as sentences, It’s the most informative the system can be.
- A **singular system** is less informative than a non-singular one.

## System of Equations

- Just like with **systems** of **sentences**, **systems** of **linear equations** can also be **singular** or **non-singular** based on how much information they carry.

## System of Equations as lines and planes

- Linear equations can easily be visualized as lines in the coordinate plane and systems of linear equations can be represented as arrangements of lines in the plane. This way, you can visualize their solutions and their singularity, or non singularity in a much clearer way.

- The notion of **slope** and **y-intercept** in a line, The **slope** of a line is a measure of its steepness. Mathematically, slope is calculated as "rise over run”,
- For the line on the **left** is $-1$ as for every unit you move to the right, the line move one unit down.
- For the line on the **right**, the **slope** is $\frac{-1}{2}$  because for every unit you move to the right, line moves half a unit down.

- In the same way as a linear equation with two variables correspond to a line in the plane. A linear equation on three variables correspond to a plane in space.
- In the same way as we used to intersect lines to get points as the solutions to the systems equations, you can also intersect planes.

## A Geometric Notion of Singularity

- There is an even simpler way to visualize singularity and non-singularity. It involves slightly simplifying the system. Note that system 2 and 3, the singular ones, are very similar since both consists of parallel lines.
- We can contract system 2 and 3 into one bucket by looking at the constants of the systems of equations, These constants are the numbers in the equations that are not accompanying the variables A or B.

![Untitled](Linear%20Algebra%2014002d6c8ead434690c93a3ba13b1e05/Untitled%2013.png)

- If we turn all these constants for all these three systems into 0 and see what happens to the plots. The new systems always have the 0.00 as a solution, so they must pass by the origin.
- Notice that system 1 is still a pair of intersecting lines, so it still has a unique solution. So it's still complete and non-singular.
- System 2 is still a pair of identical lines, so it still has infinite solutions, so it's redundant and singular.
- System 3 went from a pair of non-intersecting parallel lines to a pair of identical lines. So now it has infinitely many solutions instead of none. It went from contradictory to redundant. However, it stayed singular as before.
- So in conclusion, the constants in the system don't matter when it comes to determine the system is singular or non-singular.
- You can now start considering systems of equations where the constants are always 0, These are much simpler.

## **Singular vs non-singular matrices**

- **Matrices** have lots of very important properties and they arise from many different places in math. In our case, They will arise from the **coefficients** in a system's of equations in a very natural way.
- **Matrices** like systems of linear equations can also be singular or non-singular.

## Linear Dependence and Independence

- A system of equation is singular if the second equation carries the same information as the first one. This is the concept of **linear dependence**.

## The Determinant

- There is a much faster way to tell if a matrix is singular or non-singular, It's called the **determinant** and it is a quick formula that returns a zero if the matrix is singular and a number different from zero if the matrix is non-singular.
- the **determinant** is zero if the matrix is **singular** and non-zero if it's **non-singular.**

- The determinant for three-by-three matrix is a bit more complicated than that for two-by-two matrix, but it is mostly the same.
- Here are the diagonals in 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 matrices:

![Untitled](Linear%20Algebra%2014002d6c8ead434690c93a3ba13b1e05/Untitled%2025.png)

- For the determinant, you're simply going to add the products of the elements in these diagonals and subtract the products of the elements in these diagonals that go the other way around.
